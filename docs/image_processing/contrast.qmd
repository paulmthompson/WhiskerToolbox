These two filters are implemented with a single linear transform taking parameters "alpha" ($\alpha$) and "beta" ($\beta$). Pixel values are multiplied by $\alpha$ to adjust contrast, then have $\beta$ added to adjust brightness: $$
g(x) = \alpha f(x) + \beta
$$ In effect the magnitude of $\alpha$ corresponds to the amount of contrast and the magnitude of $\beta$ corresponds to the amount of brightness.
