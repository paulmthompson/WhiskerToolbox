title: "State Estimation Library"
---

## Core Goals

The primary goals of this library are to provide a modular framework for state estimation tasks. The high-level objectives include:

-   **Generate Smooth Estimates**: Produce a smooth estimate of a state from raw data.
-   **Compare and Validate**: Generate a smooth estimate and compare it against a pre-existing estimate, with the ability to flag potential outliers.
-   **Interpolate Missing Data**: Generate smoothed predictions that can fill in gaps where data is missing. This is in contrast to simply refining existing measurements.
-   **Assign Identity to Unlabeled Data**: Use predictions to assign identities to measured data points within a time series that has only sparse labels.

## Design Principles and Variation Points

The library should be designed in a modular fashion to accommodate several key points of variation in state estimation problems. The interfaces should be flexible enough to handle significant structural differences between algorithms.

### Data Type

The nature of the input data is a primary variation point. The library must handle:

-   **Continuous Data**: Analog time series or other continuous state variables.
-   **Discrete Data**: Data that exists on a discrete grid or set of points. An example would be making a prediction for a point within an image mask where only certain pixels are available.

### Filtering Schemes

The design must support different families of filtering algorithms, which may have different assumptions about data distributions and different methodological considerations.

-   **Kalman Filters**:
    -   Standard Kalman Filter
    -   Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for linearized systems
    -   Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
-   **Particle Filters**:
    -   Bootstrap Particle Filter
    -   Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (SIR)

### Smoothing Operations

Alongside forward-in-time filtering, the library must incorporate smoothing operations, which use the full dataset to refine estimates by making a backward pass through the data. The design should recognize that some smoothers are tightly paired with specific filters, while others may be more general.

-   **Paired Smoother**: An example is the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, which is specifically paired with the Kalman filter.
-   **Complex Smoothers**: For particle filters, smoothing and resampling schemes can be more complicated and may require filter-specific implementations.

### Ancillary Tools for Performance

To ensure high performance, especially for complex schemes, the library should incorporate specialized data structures and algorithms.

-   **Example**: For particle filters operating on spatial data, a k-d tree could be implemented to accelerate the lookup and resampling of large particle fields based on their location.

The overall goal is to design interfaces that are modular enough to accommodate these major structural variations as new algorithms and techniques are implemented.
