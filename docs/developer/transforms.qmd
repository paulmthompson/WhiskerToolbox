# Transform Catalog

The below table has all of the transformations currently available in the Data Transform widget. Each transform should have a test.cpp file (Column 2). The test.cpp file should include tests to make sure it can be populated by a JSON template (e.g. it can be run by loading data with a JSON file). Some transforms will "just work" because they are parameterless, but transforms with parameters will need to have them also described with a JSON link and put in the transform parameter factory. Documentation for users should be provided to describe the algorithm and its uses. Finally, a benchmark.cpp file should be created and placed in the same directory.
