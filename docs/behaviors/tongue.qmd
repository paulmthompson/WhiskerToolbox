The Tongue Tracking widget deals with operations related to the tongue.

## Loading
Tongue masks can be loaded through the sparse HDF5 format or binary images (where white is part of the mask, black is not).

Jaw keypoint tracking can also be loaded through CSV format. The first column should indicate frame number, the next indicating $x$ position and the next $y$ position.

## GrabCut Tool
Documentation on the GrabCut tool can be found [here](/labeling/mask.html).
