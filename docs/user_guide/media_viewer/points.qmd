# Overview

The **Points** widget appears when **Points** are enabled in the Feature Tree. It’s designed for **viewing, styling, adding, and editing keypoints** visible in the Media Viewer.\
If you haven’t loaded a keypoint dataset, you can still add keypoints; these changes will be tracked in the Data Manager (see *Data Manager → points \[link user-ref here\]*).

**Saving and Export:** Any additions or edits to keypoints are recorded by the **Data Manager** and can be **exported** later as part of your dataset.

## Widget Layout & Controls

### Color & Opacity

-   **RGB (0–255):** Enter the **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** channels to set the keypoint color.\
-   **Hex Color:** Optionally specify a color using a hex code (e.g., `#FF6600`).\
-   **Color Preview:** Shows the current color selection.\
-   **Alpha:** Controls **opacity/transparency** of the keypoint in the Media Viewer (higher = more opaque).

### Size & Shape

-   **Point Size:** Sets how large the keypoint appears **in the Media Viewer**.

    ::: callout-note
    **Data size vs. display size:** The **stored keypoint** in the **Data Manager** is always **one pixel** (a single coordinate). **Point Size/Shape** only affects **on-screen display**, not the underlying saved data.
    :::

-   **Marker Shape:** Choose how the keypoint is drawn in the display:

    -   `circle`, `square`, `triangle`, `cross`, `x`, `diamond`

## Adding & Editing Keypoints

1.  In the **Points** widget, find **Mouse Mode** (dropdown).

2.  Select **`Select Point`**.

3.  Click **anywhere in the Media Viewer** to **add** a keypoint at that location.

4.  To **modify** a keypoint, use the same mode to select it and then adjust its location in the media window.

    ::: callout-note
    **Deleting Keypoints:** To delete accidentally added or misplaced keypoints, open the data manager and find the frame that contains the keypoint and delete it (see *Data Manager → points \[link user-ref here\]*).

## Tips

-   Keep **Alpha** low to ensure that imagery remains visible under points.\
-   When working with multiple keypoints, use distinct **shapes** or **colors** to differentiate labels, annotators, or classes.
