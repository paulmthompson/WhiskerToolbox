### Digital Event Series

Digital event series are data represented by an ordered sequence of timestamps. Examples include spike timestamps from extracellular recordings or behavioral events (e.g. go cue, reward given).

### Digital Interval Series

#### 16 bit binary representation

``` json
{
  "filepath": "ttl.bin",
  "data_type": "digital_interval",
  "name": "laser",
  "format": "uint16",
  "channel": 2, // REQUIRED, bit (0 based) for channel of interest
  "transition": "rising", //optional, 
  "clock": "master", //optional, clock signal to assign to these events
  "header_size": 0 //optional, number of bytes to skip at start of file
}
```

| Element | Description | Required? | Type | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| filepath | Path to binary file, relative to JSON file. | Yes | string |  |
| data_type |  | Yes | string | "digital_interval" |
| name | Name of the data once it is loaded into Neuralyzer | Yes | string |  |
| format |  | Yes | string | "uint16" |
| channel | Specifies which bit in binary representation should be extracted as digital interval | No | number | Default is 0. Valid values range from 0-15 |
| Transition | "rising" will count a TTL interval as one extending from low-to-high transitions to high-to-low transitions. "falling" will count a TTL interval as one extending from high-to-low to low-to-high transitions. | No | string | Default is "rising". Valid values are "rising" or "falling". |
| clock | Clock signal to associate with this digital interval | No | string | The clock string must match the name of a loaded clock signal. |
| header_size | This many bytes will be skipped at the beginning of the file before reading the rest. | No | number | Default is 0. Accepted values range from 0 to size of file in bytes. |

#### CSV

``` json

{
  "filepath": "ttl.bin",
  "data_type": "digital_interval",
  "name": "laser",
  "format": "csv"

}
```

| Element | Description | Required? | Type | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| filepath | Path to csv file, relative to JSON file. | Yes | string |  |
| data_type |  | Yes | string | "digital_interval" |
| name | Name of the data once it is loaded into Neuralyzer | Yes | string |  |
| format |  | Yes | string | "csv" |

#### Tabular Binary Events (multi_column_binary)

Use this format when you have a tabular file with a time column and multiple binary event columns (0/1 values), and you want to extract intervals from contiguous "on" regions.

``` json
{
  "filepath": "events.dat",
  "data_type": "digital_interval",
  "name": "channel_v0",
  "format": "multi_column_binary",
  "header_lines_to_skip": 5,
  "data_column": 1,
  "delimiter": "\t",
  "binary_threshold": 0.5
}
```

| Element | Description | Required? | Type | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| filepath | Path to tabular data file, relative to JSON file. | Yes | string |  |
| data_type |  | Yes | string | "digital_interval" |
| name | Name of the data once loaded | Yes | string |  |
| format |  | Yes | string | "multi_column_binary" |
| header_lines_to_skip | Number of lines to skip before column headers | No | integer | Default is 5 |
| time_column | Column index (0-based) for timestamps | No | integer | Default is 0 |
| data_column | Column index (0-based) for binary event data | No | integer | Default is 1 |
| delimiter | Column separator character | No | string | Default is "\t" (tab) |
| binary_threshold | Values >= threshold treated as 1 (on) | No | number | Default is 0.5 |
| sampling_rate | Hz for converting fractional time to indices | No | number | Default is 0.0 |
| clock | TimeFrame to associate with intervals | No | string | Must match a loaded TimeFrame name |

### TimeFrame

TimeFrame objects define the time basis for other data. Multiple formats are supported.

#### Tabular Binary Events (multi_column_binary)

Load timestamps from a tabular file with fractional time values:

``` json
{
  "filepath": "events.dat",
  "data_type": "time",
  "name": "daq_clock",
  "format": "multi_column_binary",
  "header_lines_to_skip": 5,
  "time_column": 0,
  "delimiter": "\t",
  "sampling_rate": 14000.0
}
```

| Element | Description | Required? | Type | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| filepath | Path to tabular data file | Yes | string |  |
| data_type |  | Yes | string | "time" |
| name | Name for the TimeFrame | Yes | string |  |
| format |  | Yes | string | "multi_column_binary" |
| header_lines_to_skip | Lines to skip before column headers | No | integer | Default is 5 |
| time_column | Column index (0-based) with timestamps | No | integer | Default is 0 |
| delimiter | Column separator | No | string | Default is "\t" |
| sampling_rate | Multiplier to convert fractional time to integers | No | number | Default is 1.0 |

::: {.callout-important}
## Sampling Rate Required for Fractional Times
TimeFrame stores integer values. Set `sampling_rate` to convert fractional seconds to integers (e.g., 14000.0 for 14kHz sampling).
